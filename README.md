## Why here, why now?

Probably back in 2013 my friend and I had a plan, to make a cube based on the [Holiday Cube](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-articles/2013-holiday-cube-and-commander-2013-2013-11-20#2013cube). Of course, we didn't have all the cards and we didn't want to buy them. This was a quest, an epic adventure. We would grind pre-releases and trade (often as many as 5 times a year!) to get the cards we needed.

Then the worst happened. The holiday season in 2014 rolled around, and based on the strength of the previous year, Wizards decided that it was once again time to put up a [Holiday Cube](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/2014-holiday-cube-card-list-2014-12-08). This cube was not the same as the previous year, they'd crunched the numbers, seen cards be good and bad, and moreover, released new cards! We didn't want to be left behind, so we moved our target. We decided that we didn't want to trade away the cards that we'd worked so hard to get for the previous cubes though, and so a great spreadsheet arose, with numerous sheets to track all the changes, what we needed, what had rotated. But as Wizards moved to having the "Vintage Cube" twice a year, even the spreadsheet was not enough.

Finally, it became apparent that something must be done. I did this. Our wallets probably would have appreciated it more if we just quit, but that seemed to easy.

## Why don't certain things work?

You can't update my cube because I don't know you, and perhaps more importantly you don't know my cube. In order to have that available in production without user login seems stupid. Having user login without SSL seems stupid. Paying $X/month for SSL seems stupid. This project is stupid. Don't worry about it.

If you are trying to update the cube, there are some things that are commented out in the backend folder, which worked the last time I checked.
